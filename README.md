A way for contractors/freelancers to easily track their hours in a very minimalist way.

## TODO

1. Make main html view
1. Handle all complex calculations via js
1. Handle saving to localStorage
1. Date Record html view
1. Date Record js
1. Save to csv files in the repo? (This would require a node server to fire api calls)
1. Make this into a vue native app?
1. Make a node application that can be easily run?
