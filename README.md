# Payroll Tracker
A way for contractors/freelancers to easily track their hours in a very minimalist way. (Can use github issues for feature requests)

## Usage

1. Clone the repo to a destination on your PC
1. Load the `index.html` file in your favorite browser (by clicking on it this usually defaults to it opening in your default browser)
1. All Done! It works using localStorage so there is no need to setup anything extra.

## TODO

1. Update Current Timestamps with Tracker Button Press
1. Make UI Mobile Responsive
1. Allow for 12hr time AM/PM
1. Improve Hour Calculation (Seems slightly innaccurate)
1. Fix Issue with timestamps holding UTC time vs Local time
1. Refactor CSS & JS to Minimal Code (Potentially 1 JS File?)
1. Document JS
1. Be able to seperate records table by a set amount of days
1. Save to csv files in the repo? (This would require a node server to fire api calls)
1. Make this into a vue native app?
1. Make a node application that can be easily run?
