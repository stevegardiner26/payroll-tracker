# Payroll Tracker
A way for contractors/freelancers to easily track their hours in a very minimalist way. (Can use github issues for feature requests)

## TODO

1. Refactor CSS & JS to Minimal Code
1. Document JS
1. Allow for 12hr time AM/PM
1. Be able to seperate records table by a set amount of days
1. Improve Hour Calculation (Seems slightly innaccurate)
1. Fix Issue with timestamps holding UTC time vs Local time
1. Save to csv files in the repo? (This would require a node server to fire api calls)
1. Make this into a vue native app?
1. Make a node application that can be easily run?
